Waveshare transceiver serial number (Amazon Listing): SN65HVD230
PCB transceiver serial number                       : SN65HVD230D

Each Waveshare (WS) transceivers both have 120 Ohm termination resistors

BMS_CAN1 (unless specially ordered), has one 120 ohm terminator built in
    This means one WS <-> BMS_CAN1

BMS_CAN2 does not have a terminator resistor
    This means WS <-- BMS_CAN2 --> WS

Any external devices connected to the Orion BMS's CAN interface must share a common ground with the BMS (Main I/O connector pin 12)

Test Resistance on the line is correct
    No power on lines
    Total resistance should read 60
