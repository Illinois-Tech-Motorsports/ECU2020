Each Waveshare (WS) transceivers both have 120 Ohm termination resistors

BMS_CAN1 (unless specially ordered), has one 120 ohm terminator built in
    This means one WS <-> BMS_CAN1

BMS_CAN2 does not have a terminator resistor
    This means WS <-- BMS_CAN2 --> WS

BMS CAN firmware must be specifically updated per CAN Bus

Test Resistance on the line is correct
    No power on lines
    Total resistance should read 60
