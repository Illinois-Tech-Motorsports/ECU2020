Waveshare transceiver serial number (Amazon Listing): SN65HVD230
PCB transceiver serial number                       : SN65HVD230D

Each Waveshare (WS) transceivers both have 120 Ohm termination resistors

BMS_CAN1 (unless specially ordered), has one 120 ohm terminator built in
    This means one WS <-> BMS_CAN1

BMS_CAN2 does not have a terminator resistor
    This means WS <-- BMS_CAN2 --> WS

BMS CAN firmware must be specifically updated per CAN Bus
    CANdapter must individually connect to either line to program, take note of where termination resistors are located

Test Resistance on the line is correct
    No power on lines
    Total resistance should read 60
